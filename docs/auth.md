# Auth
You can setup the auth method via the enviroment varieable `GOMAILADMIN_AUTH_METHOD`, the following values are available:

* None
* HTTPBasicAuth
* AdminMail


Based on that Setting some additional parameters are needed

## None
No additional parameters are required, no auth for the Admin interface, anyone who can access the Frontend can change any settings. May be used if the authorisation happens at another place.

## HTTPBasicAuth
To Access the API or the Webfrontend a HTTP-Basic-Auth authorisation is requested. To use this Setting the Username and Password for the Basic-Auth has to be set as environment Variable:

* GOMAILADMIN_AUTH_HTTPBasic_Username -> Username
* GOMAILADMIN_AUTH_HTTPBasic_Password -> Password

## AdminMail
To access the Webfrontend a user can login with a e-mail/password combination from the Mailserver. If there are no E-Mail Accounts at the Mailserver this method will not work! To access the API an API-Key can send as HTTP-Header.

To setup a login via the GUI add the following environment Variable 

* GOMAILADMIN_AUTH_AdminMail_MAIL

e.g.

```
GOMAILADMIN_AUTH_AdminMail_MAIL=admin@example.de,othermail@example.com
```

To access only the API the following environment Variable, if it is not set or empty a API-Access is not possible (or you need to login via E-Mail and Password)

* GOMAILADMIN_AUTH_AdminMail_API

```
GOMAILADMIN_AUTH_AdminMail_MAIL=onerealysecretapikey,anotherevenmoreapikey,adshfioÃ¶qweshrguiwergtzfhqw7p
```
